# What i tried:

    I tried the sequential model using 32 filters and 3x3 kernel, Max-pooling layer using 2x2 pool size and
    repeating the process twice.
 
    After flattenning i added a hidden layer of 128 units with a dropout of 0.5.I also added an output layer with output units for all 43 traffic sign categories.
